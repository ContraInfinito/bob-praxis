## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0 - Project Initialization and Security Baseline (2026-05-15)

**Completed**: May 15, 2026, ~12:30 PM CST (Hour 4.5 of 48-hour hackathon)

#### What Was Done

1. **Repository Verification**
   - Confirmed git repository connected to https://github.com/ContraInfinito/bob-praxis
   - Verified clean working tree on main branch
   - Existing files: `.gitignore`, `test_watsonx.py`, `.env` (with working watsonx.ai credentials)

2. **Virtual Environment Setup**
   - Removed any existing venv directory
   - Created fresh Python virtual environment
   - Installed core dependencies: `requests`, `python-dotenv`
   - Generated `requirements.txt` with pinned versions

3. **Legal and Licensing**
   - Created MIT LICENSE with copyright holder "Mathew Carballo López" and year 2026
   - Ensures open-source compliance for hackathon submission

4. **Documentation Foundation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md (189 lines)
     - Project description and purpose
     - Installation instructions
     - Usage examples for both input modes (analyze and plan)
     - Project structure overview
     - Development status and roadmap
   - Created bob_sessions/README.md to document development process
   - Initialized this CHANGELOG.md for version tracking

5. **Token Tracking**
   - Created BOBCOIN_LOG.md to track AI token consumption per phase
   - Essential for hackathon resource management

6. **Security Baseline**
   - Updated .gitignore to prevent credential leaks:
     - `.env` (API credentials)
     - `venv/` (virtual environment)
     - `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` (Python bytecode)
     - `bob_sessions/*.png`, `bob_sessions/*.jpg` (screenshots)
   - Verified no sensitive data in tracked files

7. **Version Control**
   - Committed all Phase 0 changes with message: "Phase 0: Project initialization and security baseline"
   - Established clean baseline for Phase 1 development

#### Options Considered

**For Documentation Structure:**
- **Option A**: Create extensive docs/ folder with METHODOLOGY.md, STACK_SUPPORT.md, etc.
  - Rejected: Scope creep - methodology should live in generated PRAXIS_CONTRACT.md output
- **Option B**: Minimal README with external wiki
  - Rejected: Adds complexity, harder to maintain during hackathon
- **Option C (Chosen)**: Comprehensive README.md with inline documentation
  - Why: Single source of truth, easy to navigate, sufficient for hackathon scope

**For Virtual Environment:**
- **Option A**: Use Poetry or pipenv for dependency management
  - Rejected: Overkill for simple project, adds learning curve
- **Option B (Chosen)**: Standard venv with requirements.txt
  - Why: Simple, widely understood, sufficient for project needs

**For Session Tracking:**
- **Option A**: Store sessions in separate repository
  - Rejected: Adds complexity, harder to correlate with code changes
- **Option B (Chosen)**: bob_sessions/ folder in main repo
  - Why: Keeps development history with code, easier for judges to review

#### Why This Approach

1. **Security First**: Established .gitignore before any code implementation prevents accidental credential commits
2. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive README ensures anyone can understand and use Praxis
3. **Hackathon Optimized**: Focused on essentials, avoided scope creep (no YAML parsing, no methodology docs)
4. **Transparent Process**: bob_sessions/ folder documents AI-assisted development for judges
5. **Professional Standards**: MIT license, semantic versioning, changelog follow industry best practices

#### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1: Virtual Environment Activation Issues**
- **Impact**: Users on different platforms may struggle with activation
- **Mitigation**: README includes platform-specific activation commands (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **Status**: Documented

**Risk 2: API Credential Management**
- **Impact**: Users might commit .env file or struggle with setup
- **Mitigation**: .gitignore prevents commits, README has clear setup instructions with warnings
- **Status**: Mitigated

**Risk 3: Scope Creep During Development**
- **Impact**: Could waste time on non-essential features (YAML parsing, methodology docs)
- **Mitigation**: Explicit rejection of v2 features in task description, focus on core CLI
- **Status**: Controlled

**Risk 4: Documentation Drift**
- **Impact**: README might become outdated as code evolves
- **Mitigation**: Update README in each phase, keep it under 200 lines for maintainability
- **Status**: Monitored

**Risk 5: Token Budget Overrun**
- **Impact**: Could exhaust Bobcoin budget before completing hackathon
- **Mitigation**: BOBCOIN_LOG.md tracks consumption per phase, allows budget adjustments
- **Status**: Tracked

#### Next Steps (Phase 1)

- Implement core CLI structure (praxis.py)
- Add argument parsing for analyze/plan modes
- Implement file reading for analyze mode
- Create watsonx.ai integration module
- Add basic error handling
- Test with sample requirements file
